# Timenames
Timenames provides you with a unique name for each second of the day.
You can see a demo [here](https://timenames.redpapr.com/).

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
You can view the source file [here](https://github.com/iaseth/timenames/blob/master/README.md.rx).


## How it started
I was working of a [sound recorder app](https://github.com/iaseth/rex)
that gave a default filename to each recording based on the current time.
I extracted the naming logic into a separate npm package called
[timenames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timenames) and added a
[demo react app](https://timenames.redpapr.com/) for previewing.

## How to use timenames in your project
Install the [`timenames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timenames) npm package:
```
npm install timenames
```

Import the `getTimeName()` function:
```
import { getTimeName } from 'timenames';
```

Call the `getTimeName()` function with the current time to get a `timename`:
```
const timename = getTimeName(Date.now());
```
