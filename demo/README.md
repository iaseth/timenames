# vite-react-ts-starter
This is the template I use to get up and running with a new React App in 2023.
It was created with `Vite` with the following command:
```
npm create vite@latest vite-react-ts-starter -- --template react-ts
```


I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository and `cd` into it:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iaseth/vite-react-ts-starter.git
    ```
    ```
    cd vite-react-ts-starter
    ```
* Delete the `.git` directory and do `git init` for a fresh start:
    ```
    rm -r .git
    ```
    ```
    git init
    ```
* Install all dependencies with the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
* Now you can run the dev server with:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start running a development server at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
* To build the project:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    This will build your project into `dist` directory.
